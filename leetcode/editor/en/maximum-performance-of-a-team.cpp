//You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and 
//efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and 
//efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the i·µó ∞ engineer respectively. 
//
// Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team 
//with the maximum performance. 
//
// The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied 
//by the minimum efficiency among their engineers. 
//
// Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge 
//number, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
//Output: 60
//Explanation: 
//We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with 
//speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, 
//performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
//Output: 68
//Explanation:
//This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, 
//engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, 
//performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
//Output: 72
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= k <= n <= 10‚Åµ 
// speed.length == n 
// efficiency.length == n 
// 1 <= speed[i] <= 10‚Åµ 
// 1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10‚Å∏
